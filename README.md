# EagleViewReport
Mudlet / Achaea Metamorphosis Eagle View Report!

Hi! This set of triggers and alias for Mudlet implements a compact 
output for reporting on party from the VIEW command.

You need to be:
  1. A metamorph (Druid, Sentinel) or a Dragon
  2. In the right morph if needed (Eagle, Wyvern, etc.)
  3. Outdoors and flying!

Then you type 'view' and the alias will initialise the report generator
and queue the command for execution.

The party report is restricted to reporting crowds (more than 1 person)
by default. It can be changed with the 'report_only_above' variable in
the 'EagleViewPrompt' trigger.

Please feel free to extend and adapt it to your use case!

Here's some example output: https://ada-young.com/pastebin/xQLjOiFU
